# HyperzFiveM-Base
This is the most advanced and well-off Base you can get with a FiveM server!

This was originally pulled from a server I was head dev on called [Cops VS Civs RP](https://youtube.com/poogan), and which I removed a lot of the customized and paid-for resources and instead just turned it into a very solid base that anyone is free to use!

### This base includes:

- ESX with Economy Removed (It is just FXServer with a database to store phone numbers, calls, messages, tweets, etc)
- Working [Phone](https://github.com/Re-Ignited-Development/Re-Ignited-Phone) for Mumble-VOIP
- All sorts of menu's
- Sexy af [HUD](https://github.com/itz-hyperz/hyperzhuddesign-fivem)
- Similar to a knock-off PGN for custom things
- Discord Integration
- Fully Functional
- Easy Setup
- No external admin panel
- Over 200 Resources
- NO LEAKS!
- So Much More!

### Things you need to add:

- EUP (paid)
- Emergency Cars (paid (mostly))
- Paid Patreon FiveM Key
- Other optional stuff

### Known Bugs:

- ESX Like to throw errors every now and then, this doesn't appear to affect anything, and is just a slight spam in console every now and then. Just haven't had the patience or willingness to fix it, feel free to create a pull request though!
- GCPhone's camera doesn't work without screenshot-basic I believe, which is not installed in the base by default, so either get it, or don't use the camera.

### How to install:

- Download files from zip
- Extract to a folder
- Add [latest artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) to the "server" folder
- Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (You need Apache, and MySQL when in the install wizard)
- Download [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/download.php)
- Open HeidiSQL and setup what it asks you to
- Create a new database called `essentialmode`
- Import [this]() SQL file into the database
- Configure your `server.cfg` & `permissions.cfg` folder
- Swap out the logo in the `server-data` folder to be your server logo (96 x 96 px)
- Configure **ALL** of the resources in these folders: `[DISCORD], [Priority], [LEOCars], and [FireCars]`
- Double check your `server.cfg` file is good to go
- Configure the `StartServer.bat` file to be the current directory of your files
- Run the `StartServer.Bat` file
- You now have a working whitelisted server! (To remove whitelist, remove the `Guardian` resource)

Run into any problems? Go through the procedure again, make sure you got it right.
