# HyperzFiveM-Base
This is the most advanced and well-off Base you can get with a FiveM server!

This was originally pulled from a server I was head dev on called [Cops VS Civs RP](https://youtube.com/poogan), and which I removed a lot of the customized and paid-for resources and instead just turned it into a very solid base that anyone is free to use!

---

### This base includes:

- ESX with Economy Removed
- Working Phone for Mumble-VOIP
- All sorts of menu's
- Sexy af [HUD](https://github.com/itz-hyperz/hyperzhuddesign-fivem)
- Similar to a knock-off PGN for custom things
- Discord Integration
- Fully Functional
- Easy Setup
- Over 200 Resources
- NO LEAKS! :]
- So Much More!

### Things you need to add:

- EUP (paid)
- Emergency Cars (paid (mostly))
- Other optional stuff

### Known Bugs:

- ESX Like to throw errors every now and then, this doesn't appear to affect anything, and is just a slight spam in console every now and then. Just haven't had the patience or willingness to fix it, feel free to create a pull request though!
- GCPhone's camera doesn't work without screenshot-basic I believe, which is not installed in the base by default, so either get it, or don't use the camera.
